A-lists are lists that get you to documents and other lists. They can be like file folders but not exclusive (a thing can be in two or more A-lists).  They can be like documents - many A-lists can render into the full text of the reference resources.  They can be used to curate materials, which are used by rendering only a part of the materials.  They are "nodes" in a "graph," an extremely flexible way to organize ideas.
