1.=[Z/Sec/s3]

2.sec=Any attempt to pay, authorize, or promise a bribe, kickback, or any other form of corrupt payment – in any amount – is strictly prohibited.  It does not matter if the intended recipient of the bribe works in the public or private sector.  It does not matter if the intended recipient conducts business in a country where paying bribes is a common practice, “necessary to get anything done,” or “engrained in the business culture.”  And it does not matter if “everyone else is doing it.”  No officer, director, or employee shall pay, authorize, or promise to give anything of value – whether directly or indirectly through a third party – in order to improperly influence any person or entity to act favorably towards {the_Company}.

3.sec=To ensure compliance with this Policy, and consistent with our accounting policies, all transactions must be recorded accurately and with sufficient detail to identify the actual purpose for each payment.  {The_Company} strictly prohibits any “off-the books” accounts or payments, or making any false, misleading, or incomplete entries in the books and records in an attempt to obscure the actual purpose of a payment.  This prohibition applies regardless of the amount of the payment.
